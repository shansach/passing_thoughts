# Passing Thoughts React Project

This project was created to showcase basic React JS skills. This website can be accessed by https://passing-thoughts-shanu.netlify.app/ .  

## Description

This project demonstrates my familiarity with React, especially React Hooks: useState and effectState. We can create thoughts that remain only for 15 seconds on the website. After the duration, they disappear, hence the name Passing Thoughts.
